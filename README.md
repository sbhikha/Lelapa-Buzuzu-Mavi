- it has the code to create the two column subission file

## **Helper Functions that Participants need access to**

- [eval.py](https://github.com/Lelapa-AI/zindi-inkuba-notebook/blob/main/utils/eval.py) -> this file contains all the evaluation functions
- [model_function.py](https://github.com/Lelapa-AI/zindi-inkuba-notebook/blob/main/utils/model_function.py) -> this file contains functions for model inference necessary for the submission format
